        This sample illustrates how to use the Expansion Hub's Bulk-Read feature to speed up control cycle times.
        In this example there are 4 motors that need their encoder positions, and velocities read.
        The sample is written to work with one or two expansion hubs, with no assumption as to where the motors are located.

        Three scenarios are tested:
        Cache Mode = OFF    This is the normal default, where no cache is used, and every read produces a discrete transaction with
                            an expansion hub, which is the slowest approach.
        Cache Mode = AUTO   This mode will attempt to minimize the number of discrete read commands, by performing bulk-reads
                            and then returning values that have been cached.  The cache is updated automatically whenever a specific read operation is repeated.
                            This mode will always return fresh data, but it may perform more bulk-reads than absolutely required.
                            Extra reads will be performed if multiple identical encoder/velocity reads are performed in one control cycle.
                            This mode is a good compromise between the OFF and MANUAL modes.
        Cache Mode = MANUAL This mode enables the user's code to determine the best time to refresh the cached bulk-read data.
                            Well organized code can place all the sensor reads in one location, and then just reset the cache once per control cycle.
                            The approach will produce the shortest cycle times, but it does require the user to manually clear the cache.

        -------------------------------------

        General tip to speed up your control cycles:
        No matter what method you use to read encoders and other inputs, you should try to
        avoid reading the same input multiple times around a control loop.
        Under normal conditions, this will slow down the control loop.
        The preferred method is to read all the required inputs ONCE at the beginning of the loop,
        and save the values in variable that can be used by other parts of the control code.

        eg: if you are sending encoder positions to your telemetry display, putting a getCurrentPosition()
        call in the telemetry statement will force the code to go and get another copy which will take time.
        It's much better read the position into a variable once, and use that variable for control AND display.
        Reading saved variables takes no time at all.

        Once you put all your sensor reads at the beginning of the control cycle, it's very easy to use
        the bulk-read AUTO mode to streamline your cycle timing.
