# Requirements

To build Tech Ninja Team's Skystone code, the following requirements must be met:

* Android Studio 3.5 or newer (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* Lombok Plugin for Android Studio (Android Studio -> Preferences -> Plugins, search for "Lombok", choose the simply-named "Lombok" plugin and click on the "Install" button)

## Importing the Project

When first starting, the source code must be imported into Android Studio. Instructions that can be followed from FIRST are located at https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/skystone/wiki/Downloading-the-Android-Studio-Project-Folder#importing-the-ftc-project-into-android-studio

## Building and Installing the OpMode

You will need the following items:

* The robot controller phone (usually labeled "Season Name RC" on a label on the rear of the phone)

* A USB to Micro-USB cable to connect your computer to the robot controller phone

Use the USB to Micro-USB cable and connect the RC phone to your computer where Android Studio is running. From the Android Studio menu, choose "Run TeamCode", and wait for the code to be built, installed on the phone and the robot controller to restart.
