     * In other words, the processFrame() method will never be called multiple times simultaneously.

     * frame worker thread. That is, the amount of time it takes to render the image to the
     * viewport does NOT impact the amount of frames per second that your pipeline can process.
     *
     * IMPORTANT NOTE: this pipeline is NOT invoked on your OpMode thread. It is invoked on the
     * frame worker thread. This should not be a problem in the vast majority of cases. However,
