robotlib

The robotlib is a library of folders containing relevant classes which are meant to store a bunch of useful stuff to make your life easier.
Each folder conains a readme explaining the point of the code in the folder.  Each class should also be well commented.
If the class is not well commented, like the stuff in the controller folder, then its not important and isnt used anywhere yet.
