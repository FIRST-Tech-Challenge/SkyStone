sound

The sound folder contains an interface and basic sound class.  The BasicSound is as it sounds a very simple way of playing sounds.
The interface Sound can be used to create a more all encompassing sound type.

To add a sound simply place it in the res/raw folder, note you cannot use capitals.  The constructor asks for the file name but does not care for extension
